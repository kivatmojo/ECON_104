# Multiple Regression Modelling

***

## Project Prompt:  
For this project, you will work with any dataset you like, however, it must contain at least 10 different predictors and one response variable you will aim to predict. Your task will be to find a reasonable model by following the 11 steps outlined below. As an illustration of a good dataset, the file diamonnds.csv contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. The data description and file can be accessed directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds) and the goal is to predict diamond prices.
